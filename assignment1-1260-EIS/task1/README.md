**ESP32 Circuit Task 1 - Assignment 1**



**Project Overview**

This project simulates an ESP32 circuit in Wokwi that controls LEDs using push buttons.

It also displays messages on an OLED screen.



**Components Used**

\- ESP32 Devkit

\- 3 LEDs (Yellow, White, Red)

\- 2 Push Buttons

\- Buzzer

\- OLED Display (SSD1306)

\- Resistors

\- Breadboard and wires



**Working**

-Button 1 cycles through LED modes:

1. Both LEDs OFF
2. LEDs blink alternately
3. Both LEDs ON
4. LEDs fade using PWM



-Button 2 resets all LEDs to OFF.

-The OLED display shows the current LED mode.

-The buzzer activates under certain conditions.
